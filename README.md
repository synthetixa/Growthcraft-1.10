## Currently a WIP

We have tried a few attempts at directly porting to 1.8 and 1.9 and we created more errors than solutions. Please be patient as we migrate to the newer version. Due to the complexity of the original Growthcraft code-base it will take some time to make it work with the newer versions of Minecraft.
